#Fuzzy76's dotfiles repo

<pre>This is my dotfiles repo. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My dotfiles repo is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.
My dotfiles repo, without me, is useless. Without my dotfiles repo, I am useless.</pre>

So... yeah... Here it is. Instructions and documentation are coming.

# Install new Mac

1. Boot up the Mac, adding iCloud.
2. Open App store, install all outstanding updates.
3. Install XCode.
4. Open terminal and paste ```wget https://github.com/fuzzy76/dotfiles/raw/master/scripts/start.sh -O - | bash```

# Todo (this will be moved to issues once I feel the repo is stable)

* Figure out which apps needs to be added to autostart
* Figure out a better way to configure cloud syncing
* Consider phpenv end rbenv
